# Possible implementations

## Dashboard

At the moment, all configuration is done through the bot on Discord.  
In future, I would like there to be an online dashboard to configure GroundDug \(allow users with the `GD_ADMINISTRATOR` permission to use this as well.\)

## Strike system

At the moment, there is no way to warn users  
In future, I would like there to be a strike system with logged cases which can be looked at

## Delete message logs to logging channel setting

At the moment, the deleted messages get posted to the channel they were deleted from.  
In future, there should be a setting that allows the guild to toggle whether the edit and delete logs get posted to the channel they were called from, or the logs channel.
