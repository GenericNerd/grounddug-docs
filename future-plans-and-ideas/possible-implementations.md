# Possible implementations

### Dashboard

At the moment, all configuration is done through the bot on Discord.  
In future, I would like there to be an online dashboard to configure GroundDug (allow users with the `GD_ADMINISTRATOR` permission to use this as well.)

### Strike system

At the moment, there is no way to warn users  
In future, I would like there to be a strike system with logged cases which can be looked at

### Admin - misc invoke

At the moment, you have to do `g!admin ban`  
In future, I would like this to be `g!ban`. I think I can do this with a invoke on a misc command, and make that command hidden.
